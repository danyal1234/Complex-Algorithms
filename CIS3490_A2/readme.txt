Assumptions or Limitations
****************************************************
Using brute force to solve the provided 30000 point file takes too long, an output is never reached
The divide and conquer algorithm does not work as required for a large number of points such as 3000, sometimes gets stuck in an infinite loop or seg faults, behaviour is very random
